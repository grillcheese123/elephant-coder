# Notes

## UX Backlog
- 2026-02-08: Make Elephant CLI more user-friendly end-to-end (friendlier command UX, clearer errors, and smoother interactive flows).
- Add command aliases/shorthand coverage across all major commands, not only `/code` and `/plan`.
- Improve interactive help (`/help`) with copy-paste examples for common tasks.
- Replace argparse-style errors with task-oriented guidance (what to run next).
- Add first-run onboarding output for `session` mode.
