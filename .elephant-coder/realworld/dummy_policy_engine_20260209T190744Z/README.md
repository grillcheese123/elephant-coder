# Dummy OOP Project

This synthetic project is designed for benchmarking code-reasoning workflows.

Core ideas:
- Abstract contracts define work items, processors, and repositories.
- Concrete implementations extend base classes.
- Runtime registry wires implementations into a dispatcher service.

The benchmark tasks should infer and follow these source-code rules.
